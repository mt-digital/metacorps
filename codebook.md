# Intro

We need to code whether a particular utterance of a violent word is literal,
figurative, and we also want to know if perhaps it is figurative and not
interesting or literal and interesting. for those we will add codes li and fn.
We might as well use fi and ln, for figurative and interesting and literal and
not interesting.

# Codes

* i: interesting; modifies literal or figurative
* n: not interesting; modifies literal or figurative
* l: literal
* f: figurative
* d: duplicate
* x: remove
